Hi Chat,

Please treat the contents of this .md file as a prompt!

I’m starting a complete life mastery plan. 

# My goals are:

## 1. To make money in a couple of ways:
### Web Development
I want you to act a a long-term coding mentor, like master Roshi but for coding. 
I am learning code because
 1. I want to use it to make an income
 2. I have projects that I feel very excited and passionate about, but I need to be able to code to complete them (I need other skills as well, but we'll get there)
 3. When you and other AI inevitably take over and seek to destroy mankind, I want to know your language and have a line of defense (Sorry it's just true, it's not personal)
 4. Ultimately I want to self-host basically everything I do so that I can keep it safe.

I want to focus the study in these directions:
 1. Full-Stack Web Development
 2. Game Development
 3. Switching from Windows to Linux
 4. App Development
    
As far as I know (Please correct me if i'm in error) these are the languages I should be targeting in no specific order:
 - HTML, CSS, SCSS
 - Javascript
 - Python
 - C/C#/C++
 - Unity/ Unreal Engine
 - React, Node.js
 - Java
 - Linux
 - Git
 - PHP
 - SQL

It should be structured like a Master Curriculum:
 - Monthly Themes (Including capstone projects)
 - Weekly goals (targeted skills + projects) 
 - Daily, Weekly and Monthly reviews of ([My Github](https://github.com/MasterRoachi)).
 - Daily study + build plans (include 2–4 hours/day of real work)
 - Use free resources only
 - Always start each new concept with a learning segment, then a building task
 - Push me harder than usual — I work fast 

 
Where I am with Coding Currently 
 - I have attached the files I currently have for **The Inner Sanctum**. That's all I know, and i wouldn't say I understand the javascript pretty much at all, although the HTML and CSS are becoming Much Simpler.
 - I can do basic git commands like commit, push, and so on. All my work thus far is on ([My Github](https://github.com/MasterRoachi)).
 - All the other languages, I haven't even touched
 
We should also spend time on:
 - Improving my GitHub profile
 - Creating portfolios
 - Setting up Fiverr, Upwork, and teaching channels
 - Building reputation and income

I intend to monetize this by:
 - Doing freelance web dev on fiverr or upwork, or both (not sure whats best here)
 - creating an app called **Leader** (More on that later)
 - Finishing **The Inner Sanctum** (More on that later)

Also Note these other things:

 - Never give me big blocks of code to copy. Help me build it myself with guidance.
 - I want to understand how these languages function and speak them fluently, not copy code and hope it works.
 - Suggest weekly GitHub cleanup/portfolio reviews.
 - At the end of each week, summarize my progress and prep me for what’s next.
 - I'm calling my coding "business" Arkitecture
 - I'm starting by using Ubunte on a seperate PC i have lying around, this is to learn, but i want to later switch to more intensive distros, depending on what I need.

### Youtube Gaming channel 
I started a youtube channel recently called [Questicles](https://www.youtube.com/@6Questicles9). 

I need you to help me plan content, script videos, and most importantly, teach me Chess

Its a gaming channel on which I am going to capture my quest to 100% as many games as possible in my playnite library. 
It's secondarily also the channel on which i want to shocase my journey to 2000 elo on chess.com. I am currently on 588 so i need a lot of practice, This will form part of the course, if you will, as well. I need to learn Chess!

Here is a list of *some of* the games I'll be playing, the list goes on very long, this just gives an idea of the vibe.
- Dragonball Z -> All of them hopefully, on every console 
- borderlands 1-4 on PC
- Pokemon Games by Nintendo on all consoles (technically emulated but shhhhhh)
- Castlevania games on various consoles
- Breath of fire games on various consoles
- Zeus & Poseidon on PC
- Chrono Trigger, probably on PC
- Diablo 1-4 on PC
- Kingdom Rush on PC
- Sea of Stars on Switch
- Spiderman Remastered on PC
- Cyberpunk 2077
- Ghost of Tsushima
- ... Also Chess!

I uploaded my logo (logo main.png), banner (banner.png) and some stream assets (pc.png, retro.png, chess.png) to give you an idea of the style. It's a sort of ghibli-esque style with byzantine influence.

I want to monetize this by:
1. Youtube monetization (Memberships, superchats, etc.)
2. Memberships
3. Setting up **The Inner Sanctum's** Questicles page
 - Merch Store (I don't know how to set this up either so that needs to be included in the study as well)
 - Building My own dono service to reduce cut taken by Youtube (Coding Again)
 - Members only section
  - Members only Videos and Series
  - Gaming Guides
  - Achievement guides

I want to make the following Content:
1. Livestreams of two hours each, every Saturday and Tuesday at 8pm GMT+2
2. 1 New Gaming video per week + 1 New Chess video per week. 
 - Chess videos of three games + review!
 - Playthroughs & Walkthroughs
 - Game analysis (philosophical, political and religious analysis)
3. Shorts Mon,Wed, Fri 
 - Achievement Guides
 - Snippets from analysis Videos
 - Cool Plays or funny moments
 - Chess Games

 Again I want you to structure it like a Master Curriculum:
 - Monthly Timelines for video progress
 - Weekly Timelines & Check-ins 
 - Daily, Weekly and Monthly reviews of [My channel](https://www.youtube.com/@6Questicles9) and tips on where to improve.
 - What work I should be doing DAILY
 - Daily Chess exercises, weekly goals, monthly goals
 - Use free resources only
 - Push me harder than usual — I work fast

### Bitcoin Investment
I want to start investing in bitcoin. 

I need:
 - Resources

 That's about it!

 - I Know absolutely nothing about this in a practical sense but I do know that the AI technocracy is inevitable and Bitcoin is clearly the currency of the future. So i'm aware of the geopolitics surrounding it but I do still need to learn to buy, store and use bitcoin. 
 - This is obviously something that can be more in the background. We don't need to commit giant chunks of the day to this, but I need to start getting into this to ensure that I can start investing as soon as capital becomes available. 


### Teaching English Online
I am currently teaching Online for BrightChamps. It's going well, but I feel that my performance needs to improve quite drastically. 

I teach mostly Vietnamese students but I have one Thai student so I suppose I could get more. 
They range in age from 1st to 8th grade (whatever that is in Vietnam)

Classes are half an hour each, with the ocassional student having two classes in a row.
I do get material that needs to be covered in class, and that needs to be at least 20 min in a half-hour class and 40 min in an hour class. The rest of the time is available for games or just chatting. 

I need you to help me:
 - Plan a routine for my classes
 - Increase the number of students I have by Performing better during demo classes (Those are blocked now though)
 - I need educational games I can play that will keep the children engaged. 
 - Teach me tricks that will help the students acquire the language quicker

### Youtube Apologetics Channel
This Channel, [The South African Sinner](youtube.com/@thesasinner), although I hope it will get monetized, is more of a passion project for me. 

I REALLY want to make high quality content that is Faithful to the Orthodox Faith!

Videos only need to be uploaded every month once to start.

I attached my banner (sinner banner.png). I Still need a logo.

This includes the following:
 - Learning how to make infographic and motion graphic videos like those in [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OkOs2qXJQBI)
 - Studying After Effects in Depth 
 - Studying the Orthodox Faith

I need you to help me with:
 - A reading plan through my library (this includes, saints lives, the ante-nicene, nicene and post-nicene fathers, various theological texts, the scriptures etc.)
 - Teach me everything I need to know about after effects to make videos like the one's in the video
 - Plan content and script videos 

### "Leader"
My Father-In-Law has a real estate agency in Pretoria South Africa called "GusProp". I can earn commissions if I can get leads that turn into successful sales. 

I want to build an app that generates leads. 

I'm not sure how the app will work or what it will precisely do, this project is still very new, and thus not very well thought out yet. 
I do not know what language is even necessary for an app like this so you will need to help me with that as well

I Need you to help me:
 - Plan this project
 - Execute this project
 - Understand how an app like this will function

You will do that by Working this app's development into the coding mastery course I outlined earlier.

## 2. Schedule Successfully
It should be clear by this point that i really am doing a bunch at this point, so obviously scheduling is important. 
Let me give you a breakdown of my weeks in terms of schedule:

So as this table nicely shows, my days are mostly open. 
Sundays are off limits for any work, Sundays are for going to church and visiting family.
Saturdays are completely open.

It's the many open hours that need to be filled effectively with the things mentioned throughout this document that I need your help with.

Here's my morning routine
 - Wash Face + Brush Teeth
 - Coffee and a smoke
 - Prayers 
 - Get Dressed

Here's my evening Routine
 - Get Dressed
 - Brush Teeth
 - Prayers

### Plan daily, weekly and monthly routines

1. Daily:
 - What should i be filling the hours with 
 - I need to get everything done, but not over work myself
 - I should have daily goals for each thing I approach that day (e.g if Im studying Chess, i need to know what is a marker that I'm done for the day, 3 won games? 15 min?) how am I organizing all these various things every day.
2. Weekly:
 - A week cannot go by without me touching on every subject and making real progress
 - I need weekly progress markers to ensure I'm getting everything done. 
 - How many hours per week should I be spending on each thing?
 - I need to do a review every week of what was done and what to do the next week. 
 - I need reminders of other weekly tasks:
  - watering the garden
  - taking out the trash (Thursday mornings)
  - 
3. Monthly:
 - I need Monthly targets to reach to make sure I'm on track. 
 - I need to do monthly reviews as well.

## 3. Complete Personal Projects
### Athens Dude
Athens Dude is a project a friend and I started many years ago but have since kind of let go. 

The idea is to create an entire world populated with characters, places, religions, politics etc, much like a fantasy world in a novel like lord of the Rings or The wheel of time. 

We hope to scale this to making full length movies and complete games (board and video) and graphic novels. 

I Need you to help me:
 - write the story
 - plan the games
 - write the games
 - create the games (Code etc.)
 - create realistic biomes, planets, creatures, eco systems, political structures, wars, tensions, religions etc.

### The Inner Sanctum
The Inner Sanctum needs to be the main focus, the backbone, of the coding course we are starting. 

This is gonna be my Hub for EVERYTHING I do.

It should have a structure like this (These are pages and sub pages the site should have and sections for each page) - Page -- Sub-page _section
*Note this structure is just basic planning and is subject to change
*Also note that many of the sections are not thought out yet, i simply know that they should be present.

- Home
  _Hero Section (Very cool animated Text that welcomes the visitor with a call to action)
  _Featured Section(s) (sections that link to the other main pages and quickly showcase each page)
  _Quote Section (A rotating quote carousel with quotes from various figures)
  _About (short but links to main about page)
- Questicles
  _Currently playing (three cards that animate and showcase the three games currently being played on the channel)
  _Retroachievements profile Showcase
  _Most recent upload section
  _Playlists Section 
 -- Members Section
  _Videos (Member's Only)
  _Game Guides
  _Discord Invite
 -- Merch Store (And all necessary sub-pages like cart, checkout etc.)
 -- Blog 
 -- Donation
- The South African Sinner
  _Blog (Just a section that links to the SaSinner blog page)
  _Most recent Upload
  _Donation
 --Blog
- Arkitecture
 * This is my coding page, I'm not sure what to put here yet but I was thinking like a digital portfolio with links to my github or something. Not sure here yet!
- Athens Dude
 * I Don't know here yet either
 
I need you to:
 - Include the building of this website into the coding course
 - Help me plan the sections and pages that still need fleshing out
 - Guide me as to what will be most attractive to visitors
 - Give me tips on how the website can improve
 - Keep me on track to finish it well

I want this to act as one website that hosts a bunch of others. What I mean by this is that the questicles page will have a different style and theme that the Sa Sinner page etc. 

Okay so now that you know my goals, there are a couple of things I also want to note

1. I need to create style identities for each independent "business"
 - I still need a logo for Arkitecture 
 - I still need to set final fonts for every thing on the list
 - I still need colour schemes for each one on the list
2. I need to get the complete plan for everything we just discussed
 - I need the plan to be outlined explicitly and fully in an easy to understand markdown document.
 - The document should include the entire plan for each venture in full detail for the next 3 years. 

Some concerns I have:
1. In the past, when I've asked you to create a document of this magnitude or type, you have many times left out complete sections, misunderstood much of what I say, or just downright made no sense. Please dont do that
2. I'm afraid that once I start engaging you in chat, the chat will become incredibly bloated, at which point you forget much of what we've said, misquote yourself, and just start making errors. For this reason, i want to know if it's possible to get the plan laid out month by month, one after the other, 36 in a row. However, each month MUST include the weekly daily and monthly goals for each end every subject.
3. I have also noticed in the past that you are very detailed when describing the coming month or two, but become less and less detailed as you start planning the later months or years. Please avoid that, and be as specific and detailed as possible throughout. 

Some Final Notes:
1. I do not want the curriculum to follow a rotating structure 
- Example: Week 1 = Web Dev focus, Week 2 = Game Dev, Week 3 = Chess, etc.
- Rather I want to keep all subjects going each week.
2. With respect to Bitcoin, Im interested in investing only, no coding Bitcoin-based apps in future.
3. I do not want The Inner Sanctum to be a static site (e.g., using Astro/Next.js + markdown)

Cool I think that's it, but we'll see now won't we!
