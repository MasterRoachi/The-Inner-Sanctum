# Week 1 – Building the Sanctum Begins

**What I learned:**
- HTML5 structure and semantics are pretty straightforward.
- Studied Flexbox and Grid layouts — still make dumb mistakes typing it out manually, but it’s clicking.
- I’m getting more confident using GitHub and version control.
- Dabbled in JavaScript — not confident yet, but I touched the flame.

**What I built (and what's still rough):**
- Core layout for the homepage (`index.html`) is live.
- Hero section is “done” structurally — but it's going to get much cooler.
- Featured section is functional, but very basic.
- Built a working JavaScript quote carousel (auto-rotating, styled overlay) — big win.

**What went wrong:**
- Keeping track of multiple HTML attributes is tricky — I keep forgetting small things.
- I defaulted to using the GitHub Desktop app instead of terminal commands — it feels easier, but I’m missing out on CLI muscle memory.
- JavaScript still feels intimidating — I don't feel in control of it yet.

**Next week goals:**
- Ditch GitHub Desktop — force myself to commit via terminal to build real command-line confidence.
- Practice JS syntax: find quizzes, exercises, and short tasks to drill basic concepts.
- Add the merch and login section structures.
- Fully style the About section and footer.
- Add “Previous” / “Next” quote buttons + JS events.
- Make quote transitions fade in/out.
- Start building sub-pages for each main section:
  - Questicles: episode archive, game reviews, merch hub
  - SA Sinner: article index, videos, 
  - Arkitecture: project sketches, concept breakdowns
  - Athens Dude: character/world wiki, 
  - About: break into sections (timeline, current focus, vision)
